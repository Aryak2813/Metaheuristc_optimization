# Metaheuristc_optimization
Technique for doing feature selection
<h1>WHAT IT DOES</h1>
<p>
This project focuses on applying metaheuristic optimization algorithms to solve complex feature selection problems in machine learning. Feature selection is crucial to improving model accuracy and reducing computational cost by identifying the most relevant features from high-dimensional datasets.
</p> 
<H2>KEY HIGHLIGHTS</H2>
<P>Implemented metaheuristic algorithms like Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO) (or whichever algorithms you used) for efficient feature selection.

Applied the optimization technique on a real-world dataset (e.g., fraud detection dataset) to select the optimal subset of features.

Compared the performance of selected features by training machine learning classifiers (such as KNN, SVM, Random Forest) to validate the effectiveness of the optimization.

Demonstrated significant improvements in classification accuracy and model simplicity by removing redundant and irrelevant features.</P>

<H2>Why Metaheuristic Optimization?</H2>
<P>
Metaheuristic algorithms mimic natural or social behaviors to intelligently explore large solution spaces and find near-optimal solutions efficiently, even for problems where traditional optimization methods fail or are computationally expensive.

<H2>Real-world Applications</H2>
<P>
Fraud detection in financial transactions by focusing on the most indicative features.

Medical diagnosis with reduced patient data without losing predictive power.

Any domain involving large datasets requiring dimensionality reduction for better machine learning outcomes.
